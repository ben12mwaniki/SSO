# SSO Application

## Description
This is a single sign-on application that will be used to authenticate users as they access other peripheral apps (PAs). The app creates users (Doctors, Patients, Groups) and it allows the other PAs to retrieve and update this information. 

## Project status
All requisite endpoints in the server have been implemented. Current work is on improving user experience in the frontend.
